                        to either
                        pursue a career as a software developer or work on my own business ventures.

                <h1 class="sectionHead">A little bit about me</h1>
                <p>I'm a student at the University Of Victoria in British Columbia (BC), Canada majoring in Computer
                    Science
                    and Statistics. I grew up in North Vancouver, BC and moved to Kamloops, BC in highschool.
                    Later, I moved to <strong>Victoria</strong> to start school. I've grown to love this city am very
                    fortunate
                    to have
                    the
                    opportunity to complete my <strong>post secondary studies</strong> here.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="profileBlock" id="education">
                <a href="#" class="readMoreWrapper">
                    <span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>

                </a>
                <h1 class="sectionHead">Computer Science and Statistics</h1>
                <p>As a Computer Science student I've completed courses introducing <strong>Java, and Python</strong>
                    but I've
                    also
                    completed
                    personal projects in <strong>C, Python, HTML, CSS, Bash and Lua.</strong> I have a strong passion
                    for all
                    types of
                    technology. I especially enjoy using my programming and design skills to personalize that
                    technology.</p>

                <p>
                    A good example of this is a project I did in my final year of highschool. Many of my friends had
                    purchased <strong>RGB LED light strips</strong> for their rooms and I wanted too as well. But, I
                    also wanted
                                         to take
                    it to
                    the
                    next level and use individually addressable strips instead of only being able to display one color
                    at a
                    time. I
                    spent a <strong>few weeks</strong> learning C and with the help of an Arduino I created a controller for
                    that strip
                    with
                    a
                    <strong>desktop GUI written in Python</strong>. It was lots of fun playing with all the different color
                              combinations
                    and
                    I
                    learned a lot about lower level languages and inter-device communication. Looking back I see a lot
                    that
                    could be improved but considering I started the project without <strong>ever touching C</strong> I am very
                                                                                              happy with
                    the
                    results.</p>

                <p>I have always been passionate about business and the <strong>infinite oppurtunities</strong> presented to
                    those who
                    put in
                    the
                    work. From selling freezies and candy when I was 9 to now managing the Amazon Sales for a Canadian
                    motorcycle
                    apparel company. Starting in March of 2020 and growing to generate nearly <strong>$300,000</strong> in
                        sales after
                    only
                    <strong>four months.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The real world experience I've gained from starting my own <strong>eCommerce management company</strong>
                    and seeing
                    this
                    level
                    of success is invaluable in a world where startup culture is as strong as it is. I am confident
                    that
                    my
                    client will see sales in excess of <strong>$1 million</strong> on Amazon next year because of the work I
                    do.
